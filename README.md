# Description


A responsive sidebar built with HTML and CSS. The sidenav has icons and images as links unlike the conventional way of using texts as links. The major challenge in this project was re-sizing the images which were svg files. One way i did this was to create an svg extension and paste the svg code there, thereby saving the svg as an image.
